	* openid/consumer.php: 1) Fix php error. Correct array access on
	  parsed link attributes when a delegate is used.

	  2) normalize_url() now handles the case when neither 'http://'
	  nor trailing '/' are present.  It also allows eg 'ftp://' without
	  prepending 'http://'.

	* examples/simple.php, openid/httpclient.php: from Martin Atkins
	  mart at degeneration.co.uk

	  Attached is a small patch containing the changes I had to make
	  firstly to get it to run properly on my server here and to work
	  with LiveJournal. It also features some more general fixes. In
	  particular: * no SCRIPT_URI was being set on my server, so I
	  added a best-guess fallback * you were sending the full URL in
	  the HTTP request line rather than just the path component, which
	  upset LiveJournal's mod_perl code.  (Apache by default simply
	  disregards the scheme and host part, but LiveJournal replaces the
	  component that would normally do that and doesn't handle that
	  case) * the return_url check was failing where there's no port
	  number component in the URL.
