This is the tests directory for popoon.

It was created for a proper upgrade from php4 to php5, but should be
used later nevertheless, when php4 is all history ;)

The test system is based on the traditional PHP test system, so read
there more about. I chose this not because it's fantastically good, but
I'm used to it. If anyone wants to use a "real" unit-testing framework,
just go ahead.

Background
-------------

The main goal of the php4-to-php5 transition is, that the old sitemaps
still can be used and nothing has to be changed in the application code.
We branched already the popoon code. PHP4 is still the HEAD and PHP5 is
the PHP5 branch (this will change later). 

But for the tests directory, you should always use HEAD as the
tests/tests directory shouldn't differ, otherwise the goal isn't reached
;)

How to use it
-------------

go to popoon dir 
$ cvs up -A # for HEAD
$ cvs up -r PHP5 # for PHP5 branch

then go to tests and check out head (if you didn't do it above)

$ cd tests/
$ cvs up -A

now you can run the tests with

$ bash run-tests.sh

it should automatically take to correct php-binaries, if you corrected
the paths in run-tests.sh for your php4 and php5 binaries

Hope that helps
